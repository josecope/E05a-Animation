# E05a-Animation

Hello!

In this assignment, we focused not as much on building code as we did understanding it.  On both the main.pys, I copied and pasted code into the mains and then read through the lines to figure out what they do for the program.  A few of the portions were confusing, but most of the important ones were easily understood (If I understood them correctly).  The difference between main1.py and main2.py was that the animation in main2.py allowed the user to move the ball.  While reading through the codes, I left comments on the lines to explain what their functions are.

I did not do the extra credit.

Thanks for reading!
